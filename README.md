## Presentation:
This is a university assignment to develop an interpreter for a simple instruction language called LATSI (Langage tr√©s simple d'instructions) which means "Very simple language of instructions".

## Compilation:
- To use the basic version (without function calls), go to the directory "version_basique" and compile using `make`
- To use the extended version (with function calls), go to the directory "version_avec_extensions" and compile using `make`

- To run the interpreter, use `./main path_to_file`

- To delete all the useless files, use `make clean`

## Note:
- You can find some test files in the directory `test_files`
- you can find a document that explains how the interpreter works and the syntax of LATSI in the directory `rapport`
